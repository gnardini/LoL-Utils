## LoL Utils

This is a (very) simple webpage that has some basic tools to enhance the experience of playing League of Legends.

For now, you can paste the first few lines of a lobby during champion select, and a multi OPGG page with the data of all the players in the lobby will be opened. This works for the LAS region so far, but you can make it work for any region by changing it in the URL.
